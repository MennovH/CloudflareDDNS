# NetworkManager Home Assistant add-on
Home Assistant add-on for Cloudflare DDNS.
Automatically update your A records via Home Assistant, every x minutes.
The add-on uses the Cloudflare API possibilities, which are free to use.
Using this add-on as extension to Nginx Proxy Manager, provides an easy way to circumvent the need of add-ons like DuckDNS, so you would be able to use your own domain.
